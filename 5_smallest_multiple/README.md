# Smallest Multiple

The problem can be found [here](https://projecteuler.net/problem=5).

This one was a lot of fun, not because of the coding, but exploring the mathematics behind it. I'm currently not using the most efficient method, there's another method in a HackerRank version of this challenge where the limit goes up to 40, and one of the solutions can execute the code in less than 0.01s.
