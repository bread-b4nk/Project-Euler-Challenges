# Even Fibonacci Numbers

The problem can be found [here](https://projecteuler.net/problem=2).

There could be more efficient ways to set up a fibonacci sequence but I pulled it off using 3 variables. In Python it's just named as a,b, and c. It's clearer in the c code as they're named first_term, second_term, and third_term. Then each time a new term is reached, I checked if it was even or not then, if it was, I added it to an integer value to hold the sum of all even values.
