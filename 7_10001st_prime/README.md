# 10001st Prime

Problem can be found [here] (https://projecteuler.net/problem=7)

This one was also quite straight forward, however I noticed that it took a lot longer to run the code on Python than on C. I can't find a way to optimize the code yet because checking if a number is prime is meant to be a long process (at least from what I know).
