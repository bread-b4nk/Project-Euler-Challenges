# Largest Product in a Grid

Problem can be found [here] (https://projecteuler.net/problem=11)

This one wasn't too bad, I wrote 4 functions which covered all the possible four numbers: up,down,left,right,diagonals. Right took care of both left and right, up took care of both up and down, and diagonal_nw for diagonal northwest and diagonal_sw for diagonal southwest covered the diagonals.
