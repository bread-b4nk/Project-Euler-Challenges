# Special Pythagorean Triplets

Problem can be found [here] (https://projecteuler.net/problem=9)

I brute forced it, at first I limited my variables to be 0<a<333 333<b<666 and 666<c<1000, but I didn't get any valid solutions. 
I later learned by brute forcing (changing my limits to 0<a,b,c<1000) that the correct values were a = 200, b = 375 and c = 425, so I made some changes to the python code to make it take less time.
